The India project consists of two GCP projects: IN1 and IN2, each with its own GKE cluster. Within each cluster, identical namespaces are dedicated to specific applications. Additionally, each project has its own CloudSQL PostgreSQL database.

Kafka is deployed on GKE in a dedicated namespace in both regions, running in KRaft mode with 3 controllers and 3 brokers per region, forming a single stretched cluster across both GCP projects.

CloudSQL is replicated and operates in an active-passive mode, ensuring high availability and failover support. Private Service Connect (PSC) is exclusively used for internal communication between HGKE clusters, providing low-latency, secure connectivity across regions. PSC also enables private access to the active CloudSQL PostgreSQL instance, maintaining network security and isolation without exposing it to the public internet.

For securing internal communication, we use self-signed certificates instead of relying on an external certificate authority. Since all traffic remains within the private, controlled GCP network, self-signed certificates ensure encryption and authentication while providing full control over certificate management and avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
