In Cloud SQL, we create a cross-region read replica ( we have a primary in asia-south1 and a replica in asia-south2), that replica is:

Asynchronously replicated (not synchronous)
Read-only
Not automatically promoted to primary if the original primary fails

So, if the primary becomes unavailable (e.g., due to a regional outage), Google Cloud does not promote the replica for you automatically. We have to promote the replica manulay.

Manual Promotion Workflow step by step

1. Detect Failure
Detect that the primary instance is unavailable.
2. Promote the Replica
What this does:

Stops replication
Converts the replica into a new, standalone primary
Enables write capabilities
Triggers a server CA certificate rotation (if needed)

At this point, replication is broken — the old primary and new primary are now completely separate.

3. Redirect Application Traffic

Update your application or connection layer to point to the promoted replica:

Update Private Service Connect (PSC) DNS records
Or update Cloud SQL Auth Proxy instance names
Or switch internal IPs, depending on your architecture

4. Optional: Recreate New Replicas

If the original primary comes back:
It does NOT rejoin as a replica
You must destroy or export its data
Optionally create a new replica from the newly promoted instance

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Topic	                                    Limitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatic failover               Not available
Data loss	                       Possible — due to asynchronous replication (RPO > 0)
Rejoin after promotion	         Not possible — original primary cannot be reconnected
Connection redirect	             Manual (via DNS or app config)
HA support on promoted replica	 Not automatically enabled — must enable after promotion
IAM roles needed	               roles/cloudsql.admin or equivalent
