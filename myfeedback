Self-Evaluation

I have completed several important projects as a DevOps professional, supporting teams in Hong Kong, India, and Germany. This includes deploying Kafka on GKE and MirrorMaker into production.

I built production environments in India using an innovative "Stretching Cluster" approach for Kafka on GKE, which is now running successfully. I also delivered a project in Germany, creating the potential for GFT to secure a key contract.

I have strong expertise in Unity technology, particularly in designing and optimizing pipelines to ensure seamless data flow and system efficiency.

I work to create a positive atmosphere in the team and always support my colleagues. I also naturally expand my technical skills in areas like GCP, Kafka, Kubernetes, Unity, and system monitoring.

The client has repeatedly expressed appreciation for my work. I ensure client requirements are met while contributing to the success of both Unity and CorAct projects.
