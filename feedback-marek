Evaluation of Marek's Work

Marek is a great colleague who supports the team with his knowledge and helps create a positive and friendly atmosphere.

He successfully led the challenging migration from Unity1 to Unity2 pipelines. Marek quickly understood both business and technical requirements, showing his ability to deliver results even in complex projects.

He is an excellent expert with strong knowledge of Java, Kubernetes, and Kafka. Marek doesn’t stop at programming but also works to understand the technical environment where systems run. This makes him a perfect partner for me as a DevOps professional because he understands non-functional requirements very well.

The client saw this migration as a difficult project, but thanks to Marek’s skills and commitment, it was a success. His work is highly valuable to our organization.
