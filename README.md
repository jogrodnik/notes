You need to follow this link and select the name of the project you are working on. There, you will find a workspace dedicated to the project and its environments. Run the jobs located in this directory. If you are deploying the project in an environment other than HK, select the environment, e.g., india1, etc. In this subfolder, you will find jobs dedicated to that environment.

The message "Logging before InitGoogle is written to STDERR" in Cloud SQL logs typically occurs in applications or scripts that interact with Google Cloud SQL. It indicates that logging is being written to the standard error stream (STDERR) before the Google Cloud-specific libraries or configurations are fully initialized.

An Out of Memory (OOM) error coupled with the warning "Logging before InitGoogle is written to STDERR" suggests your application or system is running out of memory before it can fully initialize or operate. The issue could be related to insufficient memory allocation, unoptimized application configuration, or resource contention.

Hereâ€™s how to diagnose and address this problem:

We know the cause of the error. We need to implement a new Nginx proxy configuration, but we must be very cautious when deploying it to production. We will deploy this version at the beginning of January. The error stems from an incorrect configuration parameter: ssl_buffer_size.
We managed to replicate the error in our environment. The default value of this parameter is 16K, and we increased it to 1M. We are considering implementing monitoring of Nginx internal parameters to prevent such errors in the future.

If you're using Google BigQuery, for a Service Account to be able to read data from a view, you should assign at least the following roles:

BigQuery Data Viewer (roles/bigquery.dataViewer): This is a basic role that allows reading data in tables and views.
BigQuery Job User (roles/bigquery.jobUser): This allows running queries in BigQuery, which may be necessary if the view requires running an additional query.
Optionally, you can also assign the role BigQuery Read Session User (roles/bigquery.readSessionUser) if you're using the BigQuery Storage API.
