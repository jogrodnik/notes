cloud auth application-default revoke â€”c lears the application default credentials, which are often used in code or scripts that rely on Application Default Credentials (ADC).

gcloud auth revoke --all, it will remove all active credentials from your gcloud environment, which means gcloud commands like gsutil will no longer have access to the OAuth tokens. 
However, if you have previously saved an access token to use independently (e.g., by storing it in a variable or passing it as an environment variable), you can still use that token 
directly to access Google Cloud Storage until it expires.
