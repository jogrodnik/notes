How to Check the Status of a PSC Endpoint

In Google Cloud, a Private Service Connect (PSC) endpoint is represented by a forwarding rule in the consumer project. To check the status of a PSC connection (i.e., whether it's active and accepted by the service producer), follow these steps:

Identify the PSC Forwarding Rule:

PSC endpoints appear as forwarding rules in your GCP project that point to a service attachment. You can find them by listing all forwarding rules and filtering for those that target service attachments.

Describe the Forwarding Rule:

Once you've identified the correct forwarding rule, use the gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe command to inspect it.

Check the pscConnectionStatus Field:

In the output of the describe command, look for a field called pscConnectionStatus. This field contains information about the connection status between your PSC endpoint and the producerâ€™s service attachment.

ðŸ”„ Connection Status Values
ACCEPTED â€“ The connection is active. The producer has accepted your request, and traffic is flowing.

PENDING â€“ The request is waiting for the service producer to accept it.

REJECTED â€“ The request was denied by the service producer.
