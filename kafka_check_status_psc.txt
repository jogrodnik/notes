How to Check the Status of a PSC Endpoint

In Google Cloud, a Private Service Connect (PSC) endpoint is represented by a forwarding rule in the consumer project. To check the status of a PSC connection (i.e., whether it's active and accepted by the service producer), follow these steps:

Identify the PSC Forwarding Rule:

PSC endpoints appear as forwarding rules in your GCP project that point to a service attachment. You can find them by listing all forwarding rules and filtering for those that target service attachments.

Describe the Forwarding Rule:

Once you've identified the correct forwarding rule, use the gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe command to inspect it.

Check the pscConnectionStatus Field:

In the output of the describe command, look for a field called pscConnectionStatus. This field contains information about the connection status between your PSC endpoint and the producerâ€™s service attachment.

ðŸ”„ Connection Status Values
ACCEPTED â€“ The connection is active. The producer has accepted your request, and traffic is flowing.

PENDING â€“ The request is waiting for the service producer to accept it.

REJECTED â€“ The request was denied by the service producer.


Run 
Run a Jenkins job that enables the deployment of a Kafka cluster configured to operate in disaster recovery (DR) mode. This cluster is an independent Kafka instance (including controller, broker, and schema registry) deployed for each project namespace, with a properly configured Ingress Controller service.

To install such a cluster for a specific project, you need to select the appropriate pair of projects in the infra_project field. If you're installing the cluster for proj1, the first project in the list should be prj1, and the second should be the DR project prj2.

Next, enable two parameters:

enable_dr_mode â€“ switches the configuration generator into DR mode.

create_only_dr_cluster â€“ installs the cluster for the specified Unity project (namespace) with the correct configuration.
