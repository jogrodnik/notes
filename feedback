We have changed the Java configuration to -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0 and -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=384m.
This change is based on the experience gained during tests carried out after upgrading Java and Spring libraries.
After the change, the OutOfMemory error stopped occurring, along with a series of errors caused by the restart of the cache component. This restart was affecting the stability of other pipeline components.
In order to identify potential issues, the system should be monitored.

I want to highlight Piotr’s excellent contributions, especially on the Mesh project and optimizing the ODS pipelines. He also did a great job improving the Unity pipelines and working with the Kafka-based system. Piotr consistently solved complex challenges and delivered high-quality solutions.

Piotr creates a positive team atmosphere. He communicates clearly, is always ready to help, and makes collaboration easier and more enjoyable for everyone.

Piotr is a skilled and dedicated professional. He not only excelled in his work but also met all the client’s requirements, ensuring their satisfaction.
