Default Values for Kafka Parameters
Consumer Settings

Parameter	Default Value	Description


max.partition.fetch.bytes	1,048,576 bytes (1 MB)	Maximum amount of data fetched per partition in one request.
fetch.max.bytes	Unlimited	Maximum amount of data fetched across all partitions (limited only by max.partition.fetch.bytes).
fetch.min.bytes	1 byte	Minimum amount of data the broker sends to the consumer per request.
fetch.max.wait.ms	500 ms	Maximum time the broker waits to accumulate data before responding to a fetch request.
message.max.bytes	1,048,576 bytes (1 MB)	Maximum size of a message the consumer will accept.
max.poll.records	500	Maximum number of records returned in a single poll() call.
max.poll.interval.ms	300,000 ms (5 min)	Maximum time between calls to poll() before the consumer is considered inactive.

Broker Settings

Parameter	Default Value	Description

message.max.bytes	1,048,576 bytes (1 MB)	Maximum size of a message the broker will accept.
replica.fetch.max.bytes	1,048,576 bytes (1 MB)	Maximum size of data fetched by replicas from the leader for replication.
max.request.size	1,048,576 bytes (1 MB)	Maximum size of a single request the broker will accept.

Important Notes

Default Size Limitation:

By default, Kafka can handle messages of up to 1 MB. If your records are larger, you must increase the related parameters on producers, brokers, and consumers.
Unlimited Fetch Across Partitions:

fetch.max.bytes is unlimited by default, meaning the total fetch size is constrained only by max.partition.fetch.bytes multiplied by the number of partitions a consumer fetches from.
Rebalance Stability:

Ensure that large message size settings align with session.timeout.ms, rebalance.timeout.ms, and max.poll.interval.ms to avoid rebalances due to processing delays.
