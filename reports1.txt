Work Report

1. Implementation of Project Installation Automation

I implemented a set of Jenkins jobs that automate the project installation process in the GCP environment. The scope of automation includes:

Creating and configuring namespaces (Kubernetes namespace) for any GCP project.

Installing Kafka infrastructure in a stretching cluster mode, spanning two independent GCP regions.

Full integration of the solution with the HSBC environment, in compliance with the bank's requirements.

2. Technical Support for Unity Projects

I provided ongoing technical support for Unity projects in the areas of:

Kubernetes maintains and optimizes clusters and troubleshoots deployment issues.

Kafka ensures high availability, monitoring, and performance optimization.

3. Deployment of New Unity Projects

Using the implemented set of Jenkins jobs, I installed and configured three new Unity projects in the GCP environment. The process included:

Automatically creating the necessary resources in Kubernetes.

Configuring and deploying Kafka infrastructure in a stretching cluster mode.

Integrating the system with HSBC requirements and ensuring compliance with security policies.

By leveraging automation, the deployment time of new projects was significantly reduced, and operational processes became more repeatable and resilient to manual errors.
