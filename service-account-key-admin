To grant a specific service account the permission to manage SSH keys (create, delete) for another service account (e.g., ser1, ser2), you need to configure IAM permissions at the service account level.

Here are the steps to configure the permissions:

1. Required Permission
The key permission required is:

iam.serviceAccountKeys.create: Allows the creation of service account keys.
iam.serviceAccountKeys.delete: Allows the deletion of service account keys (if needed).
These permissions are part of the predefined role:

roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin
2. Grant Permissions to Manage Specific Service Accounts
If you want the service account (e.g., builder@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com) to manage SSH keys only for specific service accounts (ser1 and ser2), you can grant it the roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin role only on those specific service accounts.

Run the following commands:

Add Permissions for ser1:
bash
Copy code
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  ser1@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --member="serviceAccount:builder@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
Add Permissions for ser2:
bash
Copy code
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  ser2@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --member="serviceAccount:builder@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
3. Explanation
ser1@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com: Replace with the email of the first service account (ser1).
ser2@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com: Replace with the email of the second service account (ser2).
serviceAccount:builder@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com: The builder service account that will manage the keys.
roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin: Grants the ability to create/delete keys.
4. Testing the Configuration
After granting the role, test whether the builder service account can manage SSH keys for ser1 and ser2.

Example: Create an SSH Key for ser1
bash
Copy code
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/ser1-key.json \
  --iam-account=ser1@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --impersonate-service-account=builder@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Example: Create an SSH Key for ser2
bash
Copy code
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/ser2-key.json \
  --iam-account=ser2@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --impersonate-service-account=builder@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Expected Outcome:
If permissions are configured correctly, the keys will be created.
If permissions are missing, the command will fail with a PERMISSION_DENIED error.
5. Check the Policy Binding
To verify that the role was successfully assigned:

Check for ser1:
bash
Copy code
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy \
  ser1@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Check for ser2:
bash
Copy code
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy \
  ser2@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Look for the roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin role with serviceAccount:builder@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com as a member.

6. Remove Permissions (Optional)
If you need to revoke the permissions in the future, use:

Remove for ser1:
bash
Copy code
gcloud iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding \
  ser1@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --member="serviceAccount:builder@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
Remove for ser2:
bash
Copy code
gcloud iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding \
  ser2@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --member="serviceAccount:builder@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
Summary
Grant the builder service account the roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin role on the specific service accounts (ser1 and ser2).
Test the ability to create SSH keys for the ser1 and ser2 service accounts.
Verify the policy binding and remove permissions if no longer needed.
This approach ensures that the builder service account has only the necessary permissions and operates under the principle of least privilege.
