A pipeline for transforming custody data, including holdings and trades, typically involves several stages to ensure the data is accurately ingested, transformed, and stored for analysis or reporting. Hereâ€™s an overview of the pipeline stages you might set up for such a project:

Data Ingestion:

Source Integration: Connect to custody data sources, such as custodial banks, broker feeds, or third-party providers. Use APIs, FTP, or direct database connections to fetch data.
Batch or Streaming: Based on volume and update frequency, choose between batch ingestion (e.g., daily or hourly snapshots of holdings and trades) or real-time streaming.
File Handling and Storage: If working with files (e.g., CSV, XML, JSON), set up a structured storage environment to manage raw data with clear versioning and archival policies.
Data Transformation and Normalization:

Data Mapping: Map incoming data fields to standard fields in your system (e.g., translating unique identifiers to common identifiers across systems).
Cleaning and Validation: Validate data to ensure accuracy and consistency, such as validating trade dates, matching asset identifiers, and verifying portfolio allocations.
Normalization: Standardize data formats (e.g., currency conversions, date formats) and ensure holdings and trade data follow a consistent schema across different custodial sources.
Data Enrichment and Augmentation:

Reference Data Enrichment: Enrich holdings with reference data (e.g., security master data, issuer information, asset classifications) to make the data more useful for downstream analysis.
Derived Fields: Calculate additional fields, such as current market value, unrealized gains, or sector allocations for holdings, and trade impacts on portfolios.
Corporate Actions Handling: Adjust holdings data for corporate actions (e.g., splits, dividends) to reflect accurate positions.
Aggregation and Calculation:

Position Aggregation: Aggregate holdings by account, portfolio, or any other relevant category for summary views or analytics.
Trade Calculations: Calculate derived trade metrics, such as realized gains, transaction costs, or portfolio exposure changes.
Reconciliation: Run reconciliation checks with other data sources or previous records to identify discrepancies or errors in holdings and trades.
Data Storage and Management:

Data Lake or Data Warehouse: Store transformed data in a structured format (e.g., data lake for raw and cleaned data, or a data warehouse for fully normalized data) that is accessible for reporting and analytics.
Version Control: Track data changes over time, maintaining historical versions where necessary, especially for compliance and auditing purposes.
Reporting and Analytics:

Dashboards and Reporting: Use BI tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) to create dashboards for portfolio analytics, performance tracking, and trade monitoring.
APIs for Consumption: Expose APIs for downstream applications to retrieve holdings and trade data, enabling integration with other financial tools or customer reporting platforms.
Scheduled Reports: Automate report generation and delivery for regular updates on holdings and trade activity.
Monitoring and Alerting:

Data Quality Monitoring: Set up alerts for data quality issues (e.g., missing fields, validation errors) to catch problems early.
Performance Monitoring: Monitor pipeline performance to ensure timely data processing, especially during peak trading hours.
This end-to-end pipeline allows for accurate and efficient transformation of custody data, ensuring that holdings and trade data are ready for analysis, reporting, and compliance with minimal manual intervention.
